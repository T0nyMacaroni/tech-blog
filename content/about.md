Hi! I'm Anthony, an Ethical Hacker / Red Teamer from Belgium. I have a high curiosity for anything that is related to hacking, security, or tech in general. I love to learn new things, and I love helping others learn as well.

In my professional life I specialize in offensive security. I perform penetration tests in various technical domains such as: web, infrastructure, network, ATMs, IOT, OT, ... . Next to that, I emulate threat actors in adversarial emulation tests and Red/Purple Team projects.

In my personal life I like to entertain myself by playing music on my piano/guitar or by organizing a board/video game night with friends.
