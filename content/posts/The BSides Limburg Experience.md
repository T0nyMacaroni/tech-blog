Last week, I had the privilege of participating in the first [BSides Limburg](https://www.bsides-limburg.be/) conference. The event featured an array of insightful talks from talented peers in the cybersecurity field, covering diverse topics like Crowd Security, Active Directory security posture, AI-Driven Vulnerability Identification and Prioritization, Tips for finding CVEs, Always-On Purple Teaming and many more.

**TL;DR:** I absolutely loved it! ‚ù§Ô∏è

The BSides Security conferences are community-driven, and that is exactly what BSides Limburg delivered. The event was packed with interesting talks from the local security community and organized by [Tim Thaens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thaenstim/), [Stephan Van Dyck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-van-dyck-56622652/) and [Hendrik Noben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noben-hendrik/). 

I was genuinely surprised by the interesting technical talks that were presented at the conference. It is inspiring to see  local talent showcased to effectively. The many presentations I attended were fantastic, and I was a bit disappointed that I could not attend them all. On top of that, the event also included a CTF hosted by [Secure Code Warrior](https://www.securecodewarrior.com/), where participants could win some prizes.

The organization also made sure that the presenters and all other participants were taken care of. The venue and catering were sublime. They even included some "Limburgse Vlaai" as an after-lunch treat, which for me was the peak of the conference üòÜ. [(For those unfamiliar, "Limburgse Vlaai" is a traditional pie from the Limburg region) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaai). This gave the conference that local touch that I absolutely love.

This year's event had two main tracks where different talks were presented and a breakout room where drinks were served and different sponsors were standing with a bunch of goodies. You can find the full talk schedule [here](https://www.bsides-limburg.be/2025-edition/schedule). For those who couldn‚Äôt make it, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe presentations will soon be available on the website.

I'm thrilled that my local area now has its own security conference, especially since the community is relatively small. I‚Äôm already looking forward to the next BSides Limburg conference in 2026, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in cybersecurity. A little sneak peek: Next year, I will be actively involved in organizing in-person training opportunities, so be sure to keep an eye on the socials ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bsides-limburg) [X](https://x.com/BSidesLimburg)) for the latest updates.
