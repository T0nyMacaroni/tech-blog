## Intro
As an offensive security professional, or as someone aspiring to break into the field, the training opportunities in the offensive security domain have expanded over the last few years. This is very good news for anyone looking to hone their skills and learn new things, however it can become quite a maze with the many training offerings out there. 

In my previous role at a major security services provider in EU, I was the main responsible for mapping out the relevant training's and creating training paths for the offensive team. The main challenge was to find the right balance between relevant and up to date training content, and a recognized certification in the industry to put on our resumes.

That's why I decided to create a summary of practical courses, certifications and in-person instructed training offerings out there in 2025 and share it with the community. The following list contains training options based on my own research and recommendations by peers. Although it does not include every option out there, I think that the training's in this list are among the best options.

Since this list has grown bigger than I initially expected I have decided to split this post in to multiple parts. This first part will contain an overview of general offensive security content whereas the following parts will include more specific topics. Below you can find a summary of the blog posts:

- [Part 1: General Pentesting (This post)](#)
- [Part 2: Web/API & Mobile Pentesting (COMING SOON)]()
- [Part 3: Red & Blue Teaming (COMING SOON)]()

**Disclaimer:** The opinions stated in this article are solely my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer or other affiliations I have/had. Next to that, courses are not listed in a specific order (this is no ranking by any means). Just because a course is listed in my post does not mean I have actively taken or bought the course, although I have participated in many of these and plan on taking more from this list.

### TL;DR
If you are only interested in a summary, I have included a table at the end of every chapter with the necessary information.  

- [General Pentesting Overview](#overview)

## General Pentesting
The general pentesting training's cover the entry into the offensive security field. The training's listed in this section are meant to get a foot in the door when you are looking to get a job as an aspiring pentester or to strengthen your position when you landed your first job as a one. The list contains relevant, not you CEH, training material and certification exams. Although not every certification has the same recognition or value, they do contain more or less the same topics.

### Hack The Box (HTB)

Hack The Box really hit the nail on the head when it comes to gamified cyber security training. They offer a great platform with multiple training opportunities from their academy through to their pro-labs. They offer very competitive pricing for individuals as well as enterprise subscribers. Their standalone machines on their main platform are free to play and updated weekly.

#### [Hack The Box Labs](https://app.hackthebox.com/home)
HTB Labs offers a catalog of vulnerable machines and challenges you can hack/break into to learn real-world penetration testing skills. the labs range from enrty-level to insane level difficulty boxes. it is an excellent training ground for practical skills and can be a help for pursuing multiple certifications.

##### Cost
The Active and Seasonal machines are Free
If you want access to the whole content library and personal machine instances you can opt for 
VIP+ which costs €190/year

#### [Hack The Box Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/)
I wanted to separately highlight the HTB academy, as the platform gives access to multiple job role paths as well as learning modules from entry-level to expert topics to explore for a fair price. Additionally, they offer multiple certifications. Some of them I have highlighted in this blog post. The plus side is once you have completed your modules, you will keep access to them even after your subscription expires.
