## Intro
Welcome back to the series on *Offensive Security Training Opportunities in 2025*. In Part 1, I covered general pentesting training platforms, certifications, and courses that will help you get a foothold in the field or sharpen your skills as a pentester.

In this second installment, we’ll focus on training resources dedicated to web, API, and mobile application security. While some of the courses included in this list are suitable for beginners, it’s recommended to start with the foundational material before diving into the more specialized topics.

This post is Part 2 of the *Offensive Security Training Opportunities in 2025*. You can find the other posts in the links below:

- [Part 1: General Pentesting](/posts/offensive-security-training-opportunities-in-2025-part-1)
- [Part 2: Web/API & Mobile Pentesting (This)](#)

**Disclaimer:** The opinions stated in this article are solely my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer or other affiliations I have/had. Next to that, courses are not listed in a specific order (this is no ranking by any means). Just because a course is listed in my post does not mean I have actively taken or bought the course, although I have participated in many of these and plan on taking more from this list.

### TL;DR
If you are only interested in a summary, I have included a table at the end of every chapter with the necessary information.   
- [Web (&API) Pentesting Overview](#overview)
- [Mobile Pentesting Overview](#overview-1)

## Web (& API) Pentesting
Web and API training courses are valuable for pentesters looking to specialize in application security or expand beyond general infrastructure testing. This list includes hands-on labs, structured courses, and certification options that emphasize real-world attack scenarios and modern web technologies. Although some of them are beginner-friendly, a solid understanding of basic pentesting concepts is recommended before diving into these topics.

### PortSwigger

### SANS
{{< figure src=/images/training-blogpost/Sans-logo.png align=center >}}
The most elite training provider when it comes down to security trainings, however also the most expensive (by far). They offer a wide security training curriculum, from theoretical to very hands-on trainings. Always taught live in-person all over the world. Although their trainings are very expensive, they do offer student/facilitator programs which you can apply for to enter the training at a more affordable price, but still pricy. They have some of the best instructors at their disposal. If you ever have the opportunity to do a SANS course, by having your employer pay for it, it can be worth it.

#### [SEC575 GIAC Mobile Device Security Analyst (GMOB)](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ios-android-application-security-analysis-penetration-testing/)
One of the coolest SANS courses is authored and instructed by my former colleague [Jeroen Beckers](https://be.linkedin.com/in/beckersjeroen), who is also a co-author of the [OWASP MASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs). It focuses on both iOS and Android platforms. This could be the best mobile security course out there.
{{< figure src=/images/training-blogpost/GMOB.png align=center width="30%">}}

##### Cost
The course costs $8.780 + $999 for the exam. Totaling $9.779.
If you do the in-person training it costs $8.780 + $999 for the on-demand bundle + $999 for the exam. Totaling $10.778
