## Intro
Welcome back to the series Offensive Security Training Opportunities in 2025. In Parts 1 and 2, we explored foundational pentesting platforms and specialized tracks in web, API, and mobile application security.

In this third installment, weĺl turn our attention to red team and blue team training opportunities, including advanced offensive operations, adversary emulation,  detection engineering, incident response, and other operational security skills. 
Whether you’re looking to enhance your attack-side capabilities or strengthen your defensive posture, the following trainings will definitely help you on your way.

This post is Part 3 of the *Offensive Security Training Opportunities in 2025*. You can find the other posts in the links below:

**Disclaimer:** The opinions stated in this article are solely my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my employer or other affiliations I have. Next to that, courses are not listed in a specific order (this is no ranking by any means). Just because a course is listed in my post does not mean I have actively taken or bought the course, although I have participated in many of these and plan on taking more from this list.

### TL;DR
Again if you are only interested in the summary, I have included a table at the end of every chapter with the necessary information.   
- [Red Team Overview](#overview)

#### [SEC699: Advanced Purple Teaming - Adversary Emulation & Detection engineering](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/purple-team-tactics-adversary-emulation/)
SEC699 is SANS's advanced purple team offering, with a key focus on adversary emulation for data breach prevention and detection. Throughout this course, students will learn how real-life threat actors can be emulated in a realistic enterprise environment, including multiple AD forests. In true purple fashion, the goal of the course is to educate students on how adversarial techniques can be emulated (manual and automated) and detected (use cases / rules and anomaly-based detection). A natural follow-up to SEC599, this is an advanced SANS course offering, with 60 percent of class time spent in 29 hands-on labs!
